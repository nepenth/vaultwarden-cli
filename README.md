# vaultwarden-cli

A pure Rust command-line client for [Vaultwarden](https://github.com/dani-garcia/vaultwarden) (Bitwarden-compatible server). Retrieve secrets from your vault for use in shell scripts, environment variables, and automation workflows.

## Why Rust?

This project is intentionally built in pure Rust rather than Node.js. Command-line tools should be fast, self-contained, and have minimal dependencies. Node.js CLI tools require a runtime, have slow startup times, and bring along thousands of transitive dependencies. Rust compiles to a single static binary that starts instantly and has zero runtime dependencies.

Additionally, this uses the system certificate store for TLS verification, not a bundled certificate store like Node.js. This means it respects your system's CA certificates and corporate proxy configurations out of the box.

## Features

- OAuth2 client credentials authentication
- PBKDF2 key derivation (configurable iterations)
- AES-256-CBC + HMAC-SHA256 decryption (Bitwarden-compatible)
- RSA-OAEP decryption for organization vault items
- Persistent sessions with secure credential storage
- Multiple output formats: JSON, environment exports, raw values
- Search and filter vault items
- Run commands with secrets injected as environment variables
- Interpolate secrets into YAML files

## Installation

### From GitHub Releases

Download the latest prebuilt binary for your OS/arch from:

```
https://github.com/haydonryan/vaultwarden-cli/releases
```

Extract the archive and place `vaultwarden-cli` somewhere on your `PATH`.

### From Source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/haydonryan/vaultwarden-cli.git
cd vaultwarden-cli
cargo build --release
```

The binary will be at `target/release/vaultwarden-cli`.

## Usage

### Authentication

First, create an API key in your Vaultwarden/Bitwarden web vault under Settings > Security > Keys > API Key.

```bash
# Login with your API credentials
vaultwarden-cli login \
  --server https://your-vaultwarden-server.com \
  --client-id "user.xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx" \
  --client-secret "your-client-secret"

# Or use environment variables for client credentials
export VAULTWARDEN_CLIENT_ID="user.xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx"
export VAULTWARDEN_CLIENT_SECRET="your-client-secret"
vaultwarden-cli login --server https://your-vaultwarden-server.com

# Unlock the vault with your master password
vaultwarden-cli unlock
```

Note: `unlock` validates (and refreshes if needed) your API token before prompting.
If the token is expired and cannot be refreshed, you will need to run `vaultwarden-cli login` again.

### Retrieving Secrets

```bash
# List all items
vaultwarden-cli list

# List only login items
vaultwarden-cli list --type login

# Search for items
vaultwarden-cli list --search github

# Get a specific item (by name or ID)
vaultwarden-cli get "My Login"

# Get item as environment variable exports
vaultwarden-cli get "My Login" --format env
# Output:
# export MY_LOGIN_URI="https://example.com"
# export MY_LOGIN_USERNAME="user@example.com"
# export MY_LOGIN_PASSWORD="secret123"

# Get just the password (useful for piping)
vaultwarden-cli get "My Login" --format value
vaultwarden-cli get "My Login" --password   # shorthand
vaultwarden-cli get "My Login" -p           # short flag

# Get just the username
vaultwarden-cli get "My Login" --format username
vaultwarden-cli get "My Login" --username   # shorthand
vaultwarden-cli get "My Login" -u           # short flag

# Get item by URI instead of name
vaultwarden-cli get-uri github.com
vaultwarden-cli get-uri github.com -p       # just password
vaultwarden-cli get-uri github.com -u       # just username
```

### Using in Scripts

```bash
# Source credentials into environment
eval $(vaultwarden-cli get "AWS Production" --format env)
aws s3 ls

# Pass password to another command
vaultwarden-cli get "Database" --format value | psql -U admin -W

# Use in a script
#!/bin/bash
DB_PASS=$(vaultwarden-cli get "Database" --format value)
mysql -u root -p"$DB_PASS" -e "SELECT 1"
```

### Running Commands with Secrets

Run commands with secrets injected as environment variables. The secrets are only available to the spawned process and do not persist in your shell.

```bash
# Run a command with secrets from an item injected as env vars
vaultwarden-cli run --name "My Login" -- printenv MY_LOGIN_USERNAME MY_LOGIN_PASSWORD

# Run a command with multiple items (comma-separated)
vaultwarden-cli run --name "My Login, API Token" -- ./deploy.sh

# Run a bash script directly
vaultwarden-cli run --name "My Login" -- bash ./scripts/rotate-keys.sh

# Filter by organisation and/or folder instead of (or in addition to) a name
vaultwarden-cli run --org "Acme Corp" --folder "Production" -- ./deploy.sh

# Run with URI matching instead of name
vaultwarden-cli run-uri github.com -- git push

# Preview which environment variables would be injected (without values)
vaultwarden-cli run --name "My Login" --info
vaultwarden-cli run-uri github.com --info
```

Environment variables are named `{ITEM_NAME}_{FIELD}` where:
- `{ITEM_NAME}` is the item name converted to uppercase with non-alphanumeric chars replaced by underscores
- `{FIELD}` is one of: `URI`, `USERNAME`, `PASSWORD`, or custom field names

### Interpolating YAML

Replace placeholders like `((s3.username))` in a YAML file with Vaultwarden secrets and write to stdout.

```bash
# Replace placeholders and write to a new file
vaultwarden-cli interpolate --file config.yml > config.rendered.yml

# Leave missing placeholders untouched instead of failing
vaultwarden-cli interpolate --file config.yml --skip-missing
```

Placeholders use the format `((name.component))` where:
- `name` matches a Vaultwarden item name (case-insensitive)
- `component` is `username`, `password`, `uri`, or a custom field name such as `token`

### Session Management

```bash
# Check current status
vaultwarden-cli status

# Lock the vault (clears decryption keys)
vaultwarden-cli lock

# Logout completely (clears all saved data)
vaultwarden-cli logout
```

## Output Formats

| Format | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `json` | Full item details as JSON (default) |
| `env` | Shell export commands for URI, USERNAME, PASSWORD, and custom fields |
| `value` | Just the password, no newline |
| `username` | Just the username, no newline |

## Configuration

Configuration is stored in:
- Linux: `~/.config/vaultwarden-cli/`
- macOS: `~/Library/Application Support/com.vaultwarden.vaultwarden-cli/`
- Windows: `%APPDATA%\vaultwarden\vaultwarden-cli\`

Client secrets are stored securely using the system keyring (libsecret on Linux, Keychain on macOS, Credential Manager on Windows).

### Linux: D-Bus Secret Service (keyring)

On Linux, secure client-secret storage requires:
- A user D-Bus session
- A Secret Service provider (for example `gnome-keyring`)

If you see an error like `org.freedesktop.DBus.Error.ServiceUnknown` for `org.freedesktop.secrets`, install keyring support:

```bash
# Arch Linux
sudo pacman -S dbus libsecret gnome-keyring

# Ubuntu/Debian
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y dbus-user-session libsecret-1-0 gnome-keyring

# RHEL/CentOS/Fedora
sudo dnf install -y dbus-daemon libsecret gnome-keyring
```

Verify the service is available in your user session:

```bash
busctl --user list | grep org.freedesktop.secrets
```

If you run in a headless/minimal environment without Secret Service, `vaultwarden-cli` still works, but you may need to pass `--client-secret` on login.

## Security

- Master password is never stored; only the derived encryption keys are persisted
- Client secrets are stored in the system keyring, not plain text
- Decryption keys can be cleared at any time with `lock`
- All cryptographic operations use well-audited Rust crates

## Building

Requirements:
- Rust 1.70+
- On Linux: `libdbus-1-dev` and `libsecret-1-dev` for keyring support

```bash
cargo build --release
```
